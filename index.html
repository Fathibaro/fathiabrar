                <h2>Hi, I'm FathiðŸ‘‹</h2>
                <p>I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, currently in my third year, first semester. I am self-motivated, eager to learn, and adaptable to a dynamic environment. I always think positive, keep everything simple, and find the easiest yet effective way to solve any problems.

                    Throughout my academic classes, I have been studying the fundamental mechanics of turbines and pumps, heat exchanger, boiler and engines. I also have been learning some engineering standards such as AISI, ASME, and API to improve my knowledge in industrial environment.</p>

                    Futuristic Automated Technology for Home Innovation, also known as F.A.T.H.I., is a robot designed to deliver solution for automated workflow in house chores, by using IoT as its core function. It is programmed to greet and give farewell to the house guests, contact emergency number for serious in-house incidents, and to help carry stuffs around the house's yard. Although it is not perfectly functional, it resembles the future of smart home, where house chores are automated by robots. p/s: the name of the robot is voted by my team members

                    UTP was invited by Sekolah Kebangsaan Ambangan Heights (SKAH) to perform a gimmick session using a robot in the conjunction of STEM Week closing ceremony. As the Vice President (Technical) of PETROBOTS, I was assigned to form a team and help deliver this project. The gimmick is performed by a remote-controlled robot, where it moves to the middle of the stage, before popping a party-popper. The students were very excited and wowed by the gimmick, although it did not really go as planned. 

After the gimmick, we were invited to give some talk to the students as a sharing session on robotics. We also conducted a robotics showcase right after, where students had the chance to observe the robots by themselves while gaining more knowledge on the application of the robots in real life.

                    "Mobile Makerspace: Creativity Loading..." is a project initiated by Information Resource Centre UTP (IRC UTP) under collaboration with PETROBOTS. As PETROBOTS former Vice President (Technical), I am assigned by IRC UTP to form a team to conduct a robotic workshop at SMK Iskandar Shah, Parit, Perak. Our tasks are to provide the workshop module and to facilitate the participants. The workshop's participants consisted of 50 students of form 3, where some of them originated from kaum Orang Asli. 

The objective of this project is to expose young students to the STEM world, giving them the opportunity to built their own mini robot and bringing them back home for free. This project received such a wonderful feedback from the school, they proposed to establish their own robotic club, under mentoring from UTP students and staff.
